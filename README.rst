A microservice consuming JSON objects emitted by Nextflows weblog feature and stores them into a MongoDB.

**In development!**
This microservice is still experimental!

Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
This microservice is implemented with micronaut_: *"A modern, JVM-based, full-stack framework for building modular, easily testable microservice applications."*.

The target database is expected to be MongoDB_, and we are using `MongoDB's reactive stream java driver`__ for asynchronous request handling.

This microservice provides a **RESTful API** in order to consume trace objects (process information) emitted by Nexftlow_, using the `weblog`_ feature available since release 0.31.0. Moreover, workflow trace and status information can be requested via the API and therefore this microservice integrates as useful little addition in monitoring workflows submitted with Nextflow.

API
~~~~
The API is still under **heavy development**, so expext unannounced changes in the future until the first stable release. 

The `API description`__ can be accessed on `swaggerhub`_.

A **mockup** implementation for testing and client development can be accessed on host `https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/qbic/nfregistry/1.0.0`, for example:

.. code-block:: bash

  curl https://virtserver.swaggerhub.com/qbic/nfregistry/1.0.0/service/info



.. _swaggerhub: https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/qbic/nfregistry/1.0.0
__ swaggerhub_

Test
~~~~~~~
To perform the tests, simply execute this from this repo's root directory:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  ./gradlew test


Configure 
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can configure the micronaut application, server and the mongodb client in the ``application.yml`` file, provided under ``./src/main/resources``. An example config looks like this:


.. code-block:: yaml

    micronaut:
        application:
            name: nfregistry
            author: Sven Fillinger
            email: sven.fillinger@qbic.uni-tuebingen.de
            version: 1.0.0-alpha
            apiv: 1
            institution: Quantitative Biology Center, University of TÃ¼bingen
        server:
            port: 8080
    mongodb:
        url: mongodb://localhost:27017
        db: nfregistry
        collection: traces


Run
~~~~~~

To run the microservices locally, just run:

.. code-block:: bash
  
  ./gradlew run


Deploy 
~~~~~~~

If you want to deploy the microservice as executable jar, just execute:


.. code-block:: bash
  
  ./gradlew assemble
  
This will create distributions of the microservice as **zip** and **tar** archives under ``./build/distributions``.
